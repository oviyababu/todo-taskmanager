Angular+Spring Boot Task Management Application

Project Description
The Task Management Application is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage daily tasks efficiently.
Users can create, update, delete, and track tasks based on their completion status.
The frontend is built using Angular, while the backend is implemented using Spring Boot with REST APIs and MySQL for persistent storage.

Key Objectives
Improve task organization and productivity
Provide clear visibility of pending and completed tasks
Enable task tracking using due dates
Persist user and task data using a relational database
Core Functionalities
User login functionality
Create new tasks
Edit existing tasks
Delete tasks
Mark tasks as completed or pending
Filter tasks by status (All / Pending / Completed)
View overdue, today, and upcoming tasks
REST API-based frontend and backend integration
Technology Stack
Frontend
Angular
HTML, CSS, TypeScript
Backend
Spring Boot
Spring Data JPA
RESTful Web Services
Database
MySQL
DevOps & Cloud
Docker
Azure Container Instances
Application Architecture
Angular frontend communicates with Spring Boot backend via REST APIs
Backend handles authentication, business logic, and database operations
Spring Data JPA manages MySQL persistence
Application properties store database configuration securely
Docker is used to containerize the backend
Azure is used for cloud deployment
Database Configuration
Database: MySQL
Configuration is defined in application.properties
Tables are auto-created using JPA entity mappings
REST API Endpoints (Sample)
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/auth/login	User authentication
GET	/api/tasks/user/{userId}	Fetch tasks for user
POST	/api/tasks/user/{userId}	Create new task
PUT	/api/tasks/{taskId}	Update task
DELETE	/api/tasks/{taskId}	Delete task
How to Run the Application (Local Setup)
Backend
Configure MySQL database and credentials in application.properties

Run the Spring Boot application

Backend runs on:

http://localhost:8082

Frontend

Run: ng serve

open browser

http://localhost:4200

Docker & Deployment
1.Dockerfile is created to containerize the Spring Boot backend 2.Docker image is built locally 3.Docker container runs the backend application 4.The container is deployed to Azure Container Instances

Future Enhancements
1.JWT-based authentication 2.Role-based authorization 3.CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
